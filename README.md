# Form Participation
The ability to create custom form elements that extend the behavior and UI/UX of native form elements is an area that has a huge need for standardization. The packages in this monorepo enable web component authors seeking to create custom element inputs a standardized approach to do so.


### Packages

- [`@open-wc/form-control`](./packages/form-control) : A `FormControlMixin` that enables creating a web component that functions like a native form element in a standardized way
- [`@open-wc/form-helpers`](./packages/form-helpers) Form control related utilities such as implicit submit and form value parsing.
